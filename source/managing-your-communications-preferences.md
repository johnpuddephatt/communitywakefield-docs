When you create an account we will ask you if you want to receive email communications from us relating to core site functionality. If you choose to opt in to this you will receive email notifications when:

- One of your listings will expire soon
- One of your listings has expired
- An inaccuracy has been reported in one of your listings
- An enquiry has been received about one of your listings
- Someone automatically joins an organisation you administer
- Someone requests to join an organisation you administer
- Your request to join an organisation has been approved

Regardless of whether you opt in to these communications during registration, you can subsequently choose to opt in or out of these alerts individually at any later point by visiting the "Manage Account" page.
